## Overview

### Description

A skincare app which allows for users to build their skincare routine and recieve reminders based off their preferences.

### App Evaluation

- **Category:** Lifestyle/Selfcare
- **Mobile:** This app is unique to the phone because it is meant to send notifications for skincare in the AM and PM in a place that is most accesible to the user. Most people tend to check their phone first thing in the morning or before they go to sleep, allowing them to see the app notif and resolve it.
- **Story:** Allows for users to do their skincare day and night without skipping it as many people buy the products but have a harder time keeping up their regimen. This is somthing me and my friends struggle with, so I know it would definitely help us personally.
- **Market:** The market for this app would be quite large. The prevalence of skincare on social media has only skyrocketed these past few years and since then many people have adapted a skincare routine. It provides value to them by helped them upkeep their skin.
- **Habit:** This app is quite addictive, as a user would see the notification at least once or twice a day (AM and PM) for their routine and must interact with the notification or open up the app to resolve it.
- **Scope:** V1 would allow for users to enter in their skincare routine and recieve notifications for times that they set. V2 could include more information about building a skincare routine with suggestions to the users based off a skincare quiz or brands.
