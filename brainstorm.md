## Evaluating Top Ideas
1. Skincare Reminder App
- **Mobile:** This app is unique to the phone because it is meant to send notifications for skincare in the AM and PM in a place that is most accesible to the user. Most people tend to check their phone first thing in the morning or before they go to sleep, allowing them to see the app notif and resolve it.
- **Story:** Allows for users to do their skincare day and night without skipping it as many people buy the products but have a harder time keeping up their regimen. This is somthing me and my friends struggle with, so I know it would definitely help us personally.
- **Market:** The market for this app would be quite large. The prevalence of skincare on social media has only skyrocketed these past few years and since then many people have adapted a skincare routine. It provides value to them by helped them upkeep their skin.
- **Habit:** This app is quite addictive, as a user would see the notification at least once or twice a day (AM and PM) for their routine and must interact with the notification or open up the app to resolve it.
- **Scope:** V1 would allow for users to enter in their skincare routine and recieve notifications for times that they set. V2 could include more information about building a skincare routine with suggestions to the users based off a skincare quiz or brands. 

2. Things to do near me App
- **Mobile:** This app is unique to the phone as when a user is travelling and on the go, they check their phone for things to do near them.
- **Story:** Allows for users to easily explore attractions and food near them, no matter where they are in the world.
- **Market:** The market for this could be everyone with a smartphone. Even though this app is helpful for those travelling, it is also helpful for those who aren't. Even though I've been living in the same place for years, I still look for things to do near me, which can be easily done through the app.
- **Habit:** Habit for this app can be picked up quite easily, people often can find themselves in new places when meeting up with friends, or travelling, and every time they do so, can they pull up this app for suggestions. 
- **Scope:** V1 for the project would allow for the user to get a list of things to do based off their location and interact with the list to favorite items, or be taken to the website of the link. V2 could allow for users to start rating the suggestions and take that rating as an input to which order the suggestions are first shown. It could also allow users to share the places they visited with friends.

2. Currency Converter App
- **Mobile:** This app is unique to the phone as when a user is travelling or if a user needs to do a conversion, they can easily open up the app to do so.
- **Story:** Allows for users to easily convert currency when travelling and they can do so offline.
- **Market:** The market for this could be everyone with a smartphone who finds themselves travelling to new places with currency they are not used to. This can easily help them convert and learn if prices are being inflated for them or if they are fair.
- **Habit:** After a user uses it once with currency and sees how helpful it is, they can easily continue to refer to it first in the future
- **Scope:** V1 for the project would allow for a quick currency conversion of whichever currency they would like. A stretch goal is to allow for scanning currency as well if they are not exactly sure what time of currency it is. V2 could provide a user of typical prices for items so they know the standard.
